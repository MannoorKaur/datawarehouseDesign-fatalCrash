#  Data Warehouse Project

This project demonstrates a full data warehousing workflow including ETL processing, data mining, SQL analytics, and data visualization. It was developed as part of a data science coursework project.


##  Project Goals

* Clean and transform raw CSV data
* Load data into a PostgreSQL data warehouse
* Perform business-driven analytical queries
* Visualize patterns using Tableau and geospatial files
* Apply data mining techniques for deeper insights



##  Tools & Technologies

* **Python** (ETL & Data Mining)
* **PostgreSQL + pgAdmin** (Database & Queries)
* **Tableau** (Visualization)
* **GeoJSON/QGIS** (Geospatial Data)
* **Pandas / NumPy / Matplotlib / Seaborn** (Python libraries)


### `reports/`

* Final written report documenting the full process, insights, and findings



##  How to Run

1. Run the Python ETL script to prepare and load data.
2. Use pgAdmin to execute SQL scripts in correct order.
3. Open Tableau and load the data to explore the dashboards.
4. View GeoJSON-based maps for additional spatial insights.
